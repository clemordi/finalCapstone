# finalCapstone
This is for BYB5 Compulsory Task 2
 **Creating a new GitHub repository* 
 **How to push a new repository to an existing repository*
 **How to write a detailed README.md*
 **Installation of finalCapstone 

Every repo contains a README, which is a document that is intended to explain, at first glance, what a project does and how to install or test the code.

READMEs are really important because they’re the first item a user will see when encountering your code. Creating a readable README ensures that your co-workers and the public will be able to understand the intention of your program, install the software, and fork and adapt your projects.

We find it helpful to think of the README as a guide to your code or project. It’s often helpful to create sections in the README for users to learn about the project. We recommend the following sections.
